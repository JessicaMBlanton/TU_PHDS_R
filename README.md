## Data Visualization in "R" - October 24, 2024
This repository contains files for download: a short tutorial example of how to import data into R, clean it, associate it with mapping information, and produce a figure.

#### __Some Useful Resources__
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), published January 2017, really lays out a lot of theory and practice for data visualization in R. Especially check out:

  * [Ch. 3 Data visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) - ggplot2 is one of R's best graphing tools, using the grammar of graphics.
  * [Ch. 12 Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) - Data comes in many forms, but statistical analysis and plotting requires it to be "tidy"
    
[Clean Up Your Mess - a guide to visual design](https://www.visualmess.com/)

**[The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)** is a fantastic resource for inspiration and the actual R code you need to produce plots. Bookmark this one.
